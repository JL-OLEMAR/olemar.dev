## 🖥 About

This project is my personal website. The main goal was to have a place to showcase my work and where people might know me better.

I like to keep improving this project as soon as I learn more advanced technologies.
From vanilla (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to **React**, **styled-components** and using **Sanity** as a headless CMS to manage the information of the project.

I'm very proud of this project. I've learned a lot while developing it.

Make sure to stay tuned for future improvements. 😉
